===================
![Screenshot](https://quickandeasysoftware.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ThimbleweedParkExplorer.png)

An explorer/viewer/dumper tool for games using the Dinky engine. That's Return to Monkey Island, Thimbleweed Park and Delores.

Made as a test project for relearning C# so the code will be wonky.

It uses the following nuget packages:
* NAudio
* NAudio Vorbis
* ObjectListView
* WindowsAPICodePack-Core
* WindowsAPICodePack-Shell
* Newtonsoft.Json
* BCnEncoder

Return to Monkey Island:
Since the game uses longer keys for the decryption algorithm, the keys are extracted from the game's executable the first time a resource file is opened.
